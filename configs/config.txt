about_me=Hello, I am Supriti Vijay, an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science Engineering at the Manipal Institute Of Technology, India. My research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing. My past work involves Social Network Science, Interpretability and Text Classification. I'm currently a research intern at Adobe India Research. I am honoured to be amongst the six girls all over India who were awarded the Adobe India Women-In-Tech Scholarship.$#SPLIT#$During my pre-final year, I was the General Secretary of the Research Society MIT , an organization dedicated to guiding undergraduate students from a multitude of different fields in research, to foster and make the research culture more habitable for students. We’re always looking for potential collaborations and would be grateful for external assistance, so if you would like to assist the organization in any way, you can reach out to them at their email. A list of publications and projects underway is available at their website for your reference.$#SPLIT#$I come from Jaipur, Rajasthan but spent most of my childhood in a small town in Java, Indonesia. This made me experience two different worlds and learn languages. Outside research, I enjoy playing badminton, swimming and like exploring and travelling to new places.

research=My goal is to use natural language processing for social good, particularly to eradicate the implicit bias present and make the society more equitable and inclusive. I am also interested in working with low resource languages and making them more accessible and interpretable to users from all around the world, breaking communication barriers in place. Currently, my research focuses on bias in NLP, model interpretability, and low resource languages.$#SPLIT#$Please do not hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate! I’m always open to discussion, so if you have any queries related to my work or a potential collaboration, or if there’s any way I could help you, feel free to drop me a mail.
